ðŸŒŒ Welcome to Space Shooter! ðŸŒŒ

Hey there! Iâ€™m excited to share Space Shooter, a third-person space-themed shooter game that I developed using Unreal Engine 5.3. ðŸš€ This project is my passion, and Iâ€™ve packed it with cutting-edge features to deliver a thrilling, immersive gaming experience.

âœ¨ What Makes It Special?

Stunning visuals powered by Nanite and Lumen, bringing space to life with high-resolution assets and dynamic lighting. ðŸŒ 
Dynamic enemy AI created using Blackboards and Behavior Trees, making every encounter unpredictable and challenging.
Smooth animations using state machines, animation blueprints, and AnimGraphs for fluid, responsive gameplay.
Immersive in-game audio, including realistic gun sounds and atmospheric effects, to pull you into the action. ðŸŽ§
Intuitive HUD and UI for health, scores, and objectives to keep you on track during intense battles.
This project reflects my dedication to creating a fun and engaging experience, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it! ðŸš€âœ¨

Let me know what you thinkâ€”Iâ€™d love your feedback! ðŸŒŸ
